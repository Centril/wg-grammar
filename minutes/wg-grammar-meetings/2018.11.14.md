Last wednesday the wg-grammar team had it's biweekly meeting - here are the principal points:

1. Progress report on @eddyb's [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/wg-grammar/pull/13)
	- how to deal with unstable features
		- We're going to go with separate files and using `|=` for defining alternate rules.
	- when to merge @eddyb's PR?
		- There's a blocker where GLL uses a lot of ram for parsing a single file - once @eddyb fixes this we'll merge the PR.
2. testing
	- inline unit tests
		- We've decided to go with tests in separate files, mimicking the grammar file tree structure, since this brings us the advantage of being able to even had AST/parse tree expectation files
		- The initial proposed test file name scheme is `<Production>.<random_description>.<ext>`
	- testing against external corpus
		- The initial testing corpus will be rust-lang/rust, once we get to a good place we'll extend this to maybe top 100 crates.io (stable)
3. how to deal with ambiguity (declarative...)
	- eddyb thinks that's too early to discuss this, we're punting this to the near future
4. GLL
	- formatting
		- we asked for small changes on the overall feel for GLL grammars, [GLL PR](https://github.com/lykenware/gll/pull/74) with the proposed changes.
	- syntax changes
		- there were some discussions about using BNF-like `::=` for attribution of new rules but this went nowhere at least for now.
